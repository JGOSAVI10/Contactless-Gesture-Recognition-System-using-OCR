# Contactless-Gesture-Recognition-System-using-OCR
Developed an air-writing model using OpenCV and Keras for fingertip detection. Integrated Blue Prism OCR to extract and automate data organization in Excel using VLOOKUP and macros.
• Built a fingertip detection model with 85% accuracy for air writing using Python and Computer Vision libraries to address the need for intuitive gesture-based input systems.
• Achieved 90% text recognition accuracy through OCR integration, enhancing real-time productivity.
• Automated organization of document folders (dated and timed) containing real time screenshots of screen content, boosting efficiency of the system.
